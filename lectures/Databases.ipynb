    "# Introduction to Databases\n",

    "*This lesson is taken and/or adapted from the Software Carpentry Databases and SQL Workshop http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/   [licence https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/]*\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are collections of data organized in way that allows for efficient search and retrieval.  They are used extensively in business applications (e.g. for inventory, customer information), and also in scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing data in simple text files works well, but you will need to create tools to analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreadsheets are good for small and simple tasks.  (Amazon.com does not store all of its customer data in a spreadsheet!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases provide built-in search and analysis tools.  Depending on the database manager (programs like  Oracle, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft Access, and SQLite), database files have different formats, but most programs can export databases to different formats.  We will be using SQLight, which is included in the software package for the course.  Like most database managers, it uses the structured query language (SQL) and its own particular commands to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are arranged as tables. Each table has columns (also known as fields) that describe the data, and rows (also known as records) which contain the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The .csv files in the **data** directory contain measurements taken by a team of researchers during the 1920's and 1930's in the *oceanic pole of inaccessibility*, the point in the oceans furthest from land.\n",
    "\n",
    "* person.csv: Lists the researchers.  Columns are person identifier, first name and family name.\n",
    "\n",
    "* site.csv: Lists locations where data were collected.  Columns are site name, latitude and longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "* visited.csv: Lists what site was visited when. Columns are experiment id number, site code name and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "* survey.csd: Lists readings taken.  Columns are experiment id number, person identifier, type of measurement taken (salinity, temperature and radiation level) and recorded value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to browse through the data files through the command line, using *cat*, *less* etc.  You may notice that some data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "Can you use *grep* to find the missing data?  Hint:  \",,\"  \"^,\"  \",$\""

    "1. Every value should be atomic.  This means that values should not be composed of parts that we might want to use separately.  For example, first and family names should be stored separately.  If we were to store a name like Eloise St. Cyr as a single value, we might run into trouble trying to extract the family name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Every record (row) should have a unique primary key.  This could be a serial number that otherwsie has no meaning, a unique field (like *id* in *Person*) or a combination of fields (*taken*, *person*, *quant*) for *Survey* records.\n",

This is also how most music player software is built: the database inside the application keeps track of the MP3 files, but the files themselves live on disk.\n",

    "*  These libraries use a connection-and-cursor model.\n",

How long does it take this program to run? How long does it take to run a program that simply writes those random numbers to a file?\n",
