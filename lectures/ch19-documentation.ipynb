    "## 1. Readable Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Good choice of names for variables, functions, classes, etc.\n",
    "Consider these two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bad Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def s(p):\n",
    "    a = 0\n",
    "    for v in p:\n",
    "        a += v\n",
    "    m = a / len(p)\n",
    "    d = 0\n",
    "    for v in p:\n",
    "        d += (v - m) * (v - m)\n",
    "    return numpy.sqrt(d / (len(p) - 1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improved Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def std_dev(sample):\n",
    "    sample_sum = 0\n",
    "    for value in sample:\n",
    "        sample_sum += value\n",
    "\n",
    "    sample_mean = sample_sum / len(sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "    sum_squared_devs = 0\n",
    "    for value in sample:\n",
    "        sum_squared_devs += (value - sample_mean) * (value - sample_mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return numpy.sqrt(sum_squared_devs / (len(sample) - 1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is appearent that using descriptive names for variables and functions makes the code more readable and it is much easier to understand and follow what the code is supposed to be doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This not only helps when trying to expand the code to add new functionality, but also\n",
    "to find bugs easier and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding on a good name for a function or variable is not always an easy or obvious task. However finding a proper and concise name helps in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Take your time when finding a concise name for variables, functions, etc.!**\n",
    "   It will pay of in the long run."

    "### 1.2 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments in Python start with a hash `#` character. Unless inside a literal string, hash characters and everything until the end of a line is ignored by Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are an important part for code documentation, however too many comments or comments with redundant information are more distracting than helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Don't state the obvious.** A line from the above example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a += v # increment a by v\n",
    "```\n",
    "   For sure this is not a wrong statement but is just a repitation of what the code says.\n",
    "   In this case the question is, what are `a` and `v`?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Focus on the _why_ not the _what_.**\n",
    "   The code says _what_ it is doing, but at times where it is not obvious\n",
    "   why something is done, add a clarifies comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Less is more.**\n",
    "   Too many comments can distract from reading the code. Also code changes over time and\n",
    "   more often than not the comments are not immedeately changed to match the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **A superseeded comment is worse than no comment at all.**\n"

    "Docstrings are placed immedeately placed after the function- or class- declaration or\n",
    "at the very top of a Python module (\\*.py file that is imported).  It should be enclosed\n",

    "The first line should always be a short, concise summary of the object’s purpose. For brevity, it should not explicitly state the object’s name or type, since these are available by other means (except if the name happens to be a verb describing a function’s operation). This line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description. The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing the object’s calling conventions, its side effects, etc.\n",
